# Example local "dev" configuration.

Copy this folder to ~.CodeEnigma/ce-vm/ce-vm-custom to customize your environment without
enforcing it upon your whole team.
This is where you would store personal preferences that apply to you only.
The roles included here as examples will:

- create an ~/.ssh/config file so you can access restricted resources (you still need to sort out ssh-agent on your host by yourself, sorry)
- install https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh and make zsh your defaul shell
- install https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck

WARNING: These are examples only, make sure you review and adapt them, 
do not try to use them 'as is'.
