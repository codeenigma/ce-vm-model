# Mail delivery.
# All outgoing mail is aliased to the local "vagrant" user.
# The delivery can adopt one of 3 behaviors:
# - local: email is kept locally on the guest vm, using the standard mbox.
#   Use vagrant ssh and the "mail" command to read emails.
# - discard: email is sent to /dev/null and not accessible at all.
#   Use this if your app generates a large amount of mail you don't need,
#   to prevent the virtual disk to grow quickly.
# - host: emails are rerouted to the shared var/Maildir folder, as .eml files.
#   You can then read emails on your host using the mail client of your choice.
mail_delivery: host

# Composer token for github. You typically would not set it here,
